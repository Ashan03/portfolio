title: "MusiBuddy"
description: "An interactive desktop companion that reimagines the relationship between listener and device using Gordon Pask's Conversation Theory. Instead of passive visualization, the system analyzes musical structure—beats, bars, and complexity—to maintain a dynamic feedback loop. The device exhibits a form of 'aesthetic intelligence,' regulating its output to express boredom or engagement or user state depending on the song's novelty, transforming the playback experience into an active dialogue."

    <p>MusicBuddy is an attempt to build a machine with "aesthetic intelligence." Inspired by Gordon Pask's MusiColour (1953), this prototype deconstructs audio into deep structural data (Tatums, Beats, Bars) to create a feedback loop where the machine doesn't just display the music, but "performs" it—getting bored if the song is too repetitive, or overwhelmed if it's too complex.</p>
