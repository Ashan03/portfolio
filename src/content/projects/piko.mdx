        <p>
            In an era of hyper-digital fatigue, Piko explores how "softness" can serve as a medium for emotional regulation. It is a handheld robotic companion that mimics physiological rhythms, responding to the user's touch and presence with life-like breathing patterns.

<ProjectSection title="Why build it?" id="problem-opportunity">
    <p>Modern interactive rituals often demand high cognitive attention—constant notifications, infinite feeds, and bright screens. The opportunity was to design an object that exists in the "periphery" of our attention, providing comfort without demanding interaction.</p>

<ProjectSection title="What's the approach?" id="approach">
    <p>Drawing from "Social Tech" frameworks and soft-robotic research, the approach focused on non-verbal communication. By studying how humans comfort each other through physical presence, I developed a system that uses breathing as a primary feedback loop.</p>

<ProjectSection title="How does it work?" id="implementation">
    <p>Building an "inside-out" robot required balancing mechanical rigidity with organic softness. The internal skeleton supports the actuators while the external fabric skin provides the haptic feedback essential for comfort.</p>

<ProjectSection title="How is it built?" id="interaction-model">
    <p>The system architecture bridges hardware sensing with behavioral responses. The robot doesn't just "breathe"; it reacts to how the user holds it, adjusting its pace to match or soothe the user's own rhythm.</p>

<ProjectSection title="What's the outcome?" id="outcome">
    <p>The final prototype demonstrates a seamless integration of soft-goods and electronics—an object that feels less like a device and more like a living companion.</p>
