<ProjectSection title="Problem & Opportunity" id="problem-opportunity">
    <p>In complex design systems, understanding dependencies is crucial but often obscured by messy documentation. This project explores how we can transform unstructured text into clear, visual graphs to reveal hidden connections.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Approach" id="approach">
    <p>The concept emerged from observing designers struggle with "dependency hell" in large projects. I began by sketching metaphors of networks and flow, looking for ways to make abstract relationships tangible.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Approach Cont." id="approach-2" group="approach" hideTitle={true}>
    <p>I framed the problem as an translation challenge: converting linear, ambiguous text into spatial, deterministic nodes. This required a strict ontology for what constitutes a "dependency."</p>

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation">
    <p>The system is built using a combination of NLP parsing and force-directed graph rendering. The core engine analyzes text for causal keywords ("depends on", "requires", "blocks") and constructs an adjacency matrix.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Interaction Model/UX" id="interaction-model">
    <p>Users simply paste their documentation. The tool instantly visualizes the graph. Interactive nodes allow for filtering and "what-if" analysis, showing the ripple effects of potential changes.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Outcome" id="outcome">
    <p>The output is a live, navigable map of the project's logic. It highlights critical paths, circular dependencies, and orphaned requirements, giving teams immediate actionable insights.</p>
