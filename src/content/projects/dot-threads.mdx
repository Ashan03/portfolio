    <p>
        Research doesn't happen in folders. It happens in webs of connected ideas. Dot Threads is a browser extension that transforms web browsing into spatial knowledge building. Instead of burying research in folders, users create visual webs where every link connects by context.

    <p>
        Research doesn't happen in folders. It happens in webs of connected ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my thesis research on public spaces, I collected hundreds of links—architecture references, case studies, academic papers. Browser bookmarks forced me to choose: folders (hierarchy) or tags (flat lists). But <strong>my thinking happened in connections between ideas</strong>, not categories.

<ProjectSection title="The Problem" id="problem-opportunity-cont" hideTitle={true} group="problem-opportunity">
    <p>
        Existing tools didn't help:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> Linear, buried in folders</li>
        <li><strong>Are.na:</strong> Visual collections but no associative linking</li>
        <li><strong>Note apps:</strong> Text-first, not spatial</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>I needed a way to see my research, not just store it.</strong></p>

    <h3>Validating the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        Before building anything, I surveyed <strong>25+ early adopters</strong> across 3 CMU departments (Architecture, HCI, Design).
    </p>

<ProjectSection title="The Problem" id="problem-opportunity-findings" hideTitle={true} group="problem-opportunity">
    <p><strong>Key findings:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>68%</strong> struggled with bookmark systems for research</li>
        <li>Users wanted <strong>categorization beyond folders</strong> (by themes, contexts, projects)</li>
        <li>Strong desire for <strong>visual representation</strong> of connections</li>
        <li>Privacy concerns about cloud-based tools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        <strong>The insight:</strong> I wasn't alone. Knowledge workers want spatial organization, not hierarchical filing.

    <h3>Design Philosophy</h3>
    <p><strong>If thinking happens in webs, the interface should reflect that structure.</strong></p>
    <p>
        I mapped Vannevar Bush's 1945 MEMEX concept (associative trails of thought) to modern browsing behaviors:

<ProjectSection title="Approach" id="approach-principles" hideTitle={true} group="approach">
    <h3>Core Design Principles</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Frictionless Capture:</strong> Save any page in 4 clicks or less. If saving takes effort, people abandon the workflow.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Spatial Cognition:</strong> Position and proximity carry meaning. The canvas should mirror how ideas naturally connect in your mind.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Perspective Over Omniscience:</strong> Show relevant context from each node's viewpoint, not everything at once. Focus matters more than completeness.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Privacy as Design:</strong> Local storage isn't just technical—it's a trust decision. Users own their knowledge graph completely.</p>

    <h3>From Concept to Working Product</h3>

<ProjectSection title="Approach" id="approach-questions" hideTitle={true} group="approach">
    <p>
        Started with Figma prototypes exploring spatial organization. Key design questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do users add links without leaving their browsing flow?</li>
        <li>What does "spatial organization" actually mean in practice?</li>
        <li>How do you navigate 50+ nodes without getting overwhelmed?</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>The sprint approach:</strong> Prove the concept in 2 weeks, then iterate based on real usage.</p>

    <h3>The Core Experience</h3>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="4-step workflow diagram: Find page -> Right-click save -> Tag/connect -> View on canvas" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-decision1" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <h3>Design Decision 1: Right-Click to Save</h3>
    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Integrate with browser's context menu for frictionless capture.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Users shouldn't need to open a new tab or panel. The context menu keeps the flow natural—right-click any page and save instantly.</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="200px" caption="Screenshot showing right-click context menu with 'Save to Dot Threads' highlighted" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-detail" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <p><strong>Design detail:</strong> The save popup suggests existing dots from your graph, making it easy to build context as you browse.</p>
</ProjectSection>

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-decision2" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <h3>Design Decision 2: Hero-Centric Traversal</h3>
    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Each node becomes the "hero" of its own view. Click a node → canvas reorganizes around it.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Showing the entire graph at once is overwhelming. Instead, I designed each dot to have its own "perspective"—showing only its immediate context (primary connections) and suggestions (secondary connections).</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="Before/after side-by-side - graph reorganizing when clicking a different node" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-decision2-why" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Maps work because you know where you are. Graphs need the same orientation. Hero-centric views give users that anchor point.</p>

    <h3>Design Decision 3: Visual Hierarchy by Depth</h3>
    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Not all connections are equal—depth should be visual.</p>
    <p><strong>Visual system:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary links</strong> (your manual connections): Bold, 60% opacity</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary links</strong> (connections of connections): Medium, 30% opacity</li>
        <li><strong>Tertiary links</strong> (third-degree): Faint, 15% opacity</li>
    </ul>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="300px" caption="Diagram showing three link types with different visual weights" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-nav" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> This creates a natural fade from "definitely relevant" to "maybe interesting." Users can focus on core connections while peripheral ones provide context without noise.</p>

    <h3>Navigation Patterns</h3>
    <p><strong>Hovering:</strong> Highlights the node and its immediate connections</p>
    <p><strong>Zooming:</strong> Text labels fade smoothly (semantic zoom) to keep readability at any scale</p>
    <p><strong>Searching:</strong> Keyboard-driven dropdown with real-time filtering</p>
    <p><strong>Why these interactions?</strong> Each one reduces friction between thinking and capturing. The tool should feel like an extension of thought, not a separate database to manage.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation">
    <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
    <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> Browser extension + spatial canvas web app</p>
    <p><strong>Data layer:</strong> All data stored locally using browser storage APIs—no cloud, no servers, complete privacy</p>
    <p><strong>Visualization:</strong> Force-directed graph layout with physics simulation for natural spacing</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="300px" caption="Simple architecture diagram: Browser Extension ↔ Local Storage ↔ Web View" />

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation-local" hideTitle={true} group="implementation">
    <h3>Why Local-First?</h3>
    <p>This wasn't just a technical decision—it was a <strong>design philosophy</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Users control their knowledge completely</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> No network latency, works offline</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> No servers to compromise, no data to sell</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No accounts, no authentication, zero friction</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>The tradeoff:</strong> No cross-device sync. But for researchers who value privacy, this is the right choice.</p>

    <h3>Design System</h3>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="Screenshot showing the visual design system in action" />

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation-design" hideTitle={true} group="implementation">
    <p><strong>Colors:</strong> Custom types with user-defined colors. Hierarchy uses grayscale to distinguish depth.</p>
    <p><strong>Typography:</strong> Labels constant size (12px) regardless of zoom. Bold weight for selected node.</p>
    <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Nodes "bloom" outward when appearing (600ms cubic easing). Smooth camera transitions.</p>
    <p><strong>Why organic?</strong> Knowledge graphs should feel like living structures, not rigid diagrams. The physics simulation creates natural spacing—nodes find their own positions through simulated forces.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Reflection" id="reflection">
    <h3>Spatial Interfaces Need Perspective, Not Omniscience</h3>
    <p>My first instinct was to show the entire graph at once. That's overwhelming. <strong>Hero-centric views</strong> solve this: show context from each node's perspective. Maps work because you know where you are. Graphs need the same orientation.</p>

    <h3>Visual Representation Amplifies Thinking</h3>
    <p>Seeing connections makes patterns visible that stay hidden in folders: clusters reveal themes, gaps show unexplored areas, bridges surface insights. The canvas isn't just storage—it's a <strong>thinking tool</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Frictionless Capture is Everything</h3>
    <p>I tested versions with 6, 8, 10 clicks. Every additional step compounds friction. <strong>4 clicks is the maximum</strong> before people abandon the workflow. The right-click save was the make-or-break feature.</p>

    <h3>Users Need Onboarding for Spatial Thinking</h3>
    <p>Spatial organization is powerful but <strong>unfamiliar</strong>. Most people have spent years with folder-based thinking. Next iteration needs guided onboarding showing how to build your first knowledge web.</p>

    <h3>Shipping Teaches What Prototyping Can't</h3>
    <p>Real issues I never saw in Figma: overlapping connections, organizing the 100th dot vs the 10th. <strong>Lesson:</strong> Ship earlier. Real usage reveals real problems that prototypes hide.</p>

    <h3>What Makes a Good Tool for Thought?</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Resist Prescriptiveness:</strong> Don't force structure.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Make Thinking Visible:</strong> Visualization is cognition.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Reduce Friction to Zero:</strong> Input must be frictionless.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Respect Privacy:</strong> Local-first is about trust.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Ship and Learn:</strong> Real usage teaches what assumptions were wrong.</p>
