<div slot="intro">
    <p>
        Research doesn't happen in folders. It happens in webs of connected ideas. Dot Threads is a browser extension that transforms web browsing into spatial knowledge building. Instead of burying research in folders, users create visual webs where every link connects by context.

<ProjectSection title="The Problem" id="problem-opportunity">

<p>
    <strong>Short story time!</strong> I was researching embodied interfaces for my thesis when I found a paper called <em>Emoto — AI Sidekick</em>. The work was compelling, so I did what any researcher does: I looked up the authors. Three were from CMU, and out of which two from the School of Design! That was interesting. I kept digging.
</p>
<p>
    I discovered that two of those authors continued working together and joined Experiments with Google. Four years later, they started their own company. A third author moved to Apple as a prototyper. 
    The fourth, a professor, relocated to Northumbria University and started a lab and worked on "Spooky Technology"—a project I recognized because I’d worked with one of its collaborators, Daragh Byrne, at CMU’s School of Architecture.
</p>
<p>
    This web of connections—people, projects, companies, labs—told a story. If I ever encountered someone else who worked at Experiments with Google, I’d want to connect them to this thread.
</p>

<div class="centered-tagline">
    But here’s the problem: bookmarks don’t preserve these connections.
</div>

<p>
    With traditional bookmarking, I’d save all these profiles in folders: "People," "Companies," "Labs," "Projects." The folders grow. Three months later, I’d have no idea how these things connected. The story would be lost.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>I needed a way to see the story behind my rabbit holes later, not just store them.</strong>

    <h3>Validating the Problem</h3>
    <p>
        To see if there is a broader pattern with this problem, I got to survey 25 people across 3 CMU departments (Architecture, HCI, Design) using an <a href="https://narayan-s-research-assistant-851405604897.us-west1.run.app" target="_blank" class="bento-button">AI conversational research assistant <span style="margin-left: 6px;">↗</span></a> for these sessions—letting people describe their actual bookmarking behavior instead of forcing multiple-choice answers.
    </p>
</ProjectSection>

<ProjectSection title="The Problem" id="problem-opportunity-insight" hideTitle={true} group="problem-opportunity">
    <p>
        <strong>The insight:</strong> Bookmarking systems break at scale. As the list keeps growing, people either abandon the system or can't remember where they filed things—which defeats the whole point of saving things for future use. Sharing bookmarks adds another layer of complexity, forcing people to use other tools like Are.na, OneTab, or Notion. This fragments their workflow across multiple tools, breaking the flow they were already in.

    <h3>MEMEX as Framework</h3>
    <p>
        In 1945, Vannevar Bush proposed MEMEX—a desk-sized machine for saving information through associative trails instead of categories. The idea: record links between ideas the way thinking actually happens, not the way filing systems force organization. This concept later inspired the creation of hyperlinks.
    </p>
    <p>
        Bush outlined five fundamentals: recording, storing, displaying, selecting, and sharing trails of thought.
    </p>

<ProjectSection title="Approach" id="approach-principles" hideTitle={true} group="approach">
    <p>
        MEMEX provided a structure for breaking down the bookmarking problem into actionable components. Two of Bush's fundamentals particularly shaped the direction:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Displaying:</strong> Bush wrote about making connections visible through spatial positioning—"trails" that show how things are associated and how one idea leads to another. This resonated with what users described: folders hide how things relate. The challenge became: how to make relationships visible without overwhelming the interface.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Sharing trails:</strong> Bush emphasized sharing entire paths of thought, not isolated items. This aligned with the user study finding—people struggled to share specific bookmarks scattered across lists. But sharing raised an immediate question: where should the data live? Cloud storage enables sharing but creates dependency. This tension pushed toward local-first architecture as a core constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
        These two aspects—visible relationships and data ownership—became the organizing principles for the design process.
    </p>
    <h3>From Concept to Working Product</h3>

<ProjectSection title="Approach" id="approach-questions" hideTitle={true} group="approach">
    <p>
        Started with Figma prototypes exploring spatial organization. Key design questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>How do users add links without leaving their browsing flow?</li>
        <li>What does "spatial organization" actually mean in practice?</li>
        <li>How do you navigate 50+ nodes without getting overwhelmed?</li>
    </ul>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="Figma prototype showing the spatial agency reference graph" />

<ProjectSection title="Approach" id="approach-sprint" hideTitle={true} group="approach">
    <p><strong>The sprint approach:</strong> Prove the concept in 2 weeks, then iterate based on real usage.</p>

    <h3>The Core Experience</h3>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="4-step workflow diagram: Find page -> Right-click save -> Tag/connect -> View on canvas" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-decision1" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <h3>Design Decision 1: Right-Click to Save</h3>
    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Integrate with browser's context menu for frictionless capture.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Users shouldn't need to open a new tab or panel. The context menu keeps the flow natural—right-click any page and save instantly.</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="200px" caption="Screenshot showing right-click context menu with 'Save to Dot Threads' highlighted" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-detail" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <p><strong>Design detail:</strong> The save popup suggests existing dots from your graph, making it easy to build context as you browse.</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="300px" caption="Save popup showing suggested connections and tag input" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-decision2" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <h3>Design Decision 2: Hero-Centric Traversal</h3>
    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Each node becomes the "hero" of its own view. Click a node → canvas reorganizes around it.</p>
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> Showing the entire graph at once is overwhelming. Instead, I designed each dot to have its own "perspective"—showing only its immediate context (primary connections) and suggestions (secondary connections).</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="Before/after side-by-side - graph reorganizing when clicking a different node" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-decision2-why" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Maps work because you know where you are. Graphs need the same orientation. Hero-centric views give users that anchor point.</p>

    <h3>Design Decision 3: Visual Hierarchy by Depth</h3>
    <p><strong>Decision:</strong> Not all connections are equal—depth should be visual.</p>
    <p><strong>Visual system:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary links</strong> (your manual connections): Bold, 60% opacity</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary links</strong> (connections of connections): Medium, 30% opacity</li>
        <li><strong>Tertiary links</strong> (third-degree): Faint, 15% opacity</li>
    </ul>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="300px" caption="Diagram showing three link types with different visual weights" />

<ProjectSection title="Interaction" id="interaction-nav" hideTitle={true} group="interaction-model">
    <p><strong>Why:</strong> This creates a natural fade from "definitely relevant" to "maybe interesting." Users can focus on core connections while peripheral ones provide context without noise.</p>

    <h3>Navigation Patterns</h3>
    <p><strong>Hovering:</strong> Highlights the node and its immediate connections</p>
    <p><strong>Zooming:</strong> Text labels fade smoothly (semantic zoom) to keep readability at any scale</p>
    <p><strong>Searching:</strong> Keyboard-driven dropdown with real-time filtering</p>
    <p><strong>Why these interactions?</strong> Each one reduces friction between thinking and capturing. The tool should feel like an extension of thought, not a separate database to manage.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation">
    <h3>Technical Approach</h3>
    <p><strong>Architecture:</strong> Browser extension + spatial canvas web app</p>
    <p><strong>Data layer:</strong> All data stored locally using browser storage APIs—no cloud, no servers, complete privacy</p>
    <p><strong>Visualization:</strong> Force-directed graph layout with physics simulation for natural spacing</p>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="300px" caption="Simple architecture diagram: Browser Extension ↔ Local Storage ↔ Web View" />

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation-local" hideTitle={true} group="implementation">
    <h3>Why Local-First?</h3>
    <p>This wasn't just a technical decision—it was a <strong>design philosophy</strong>:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> Users control their knowledge completely</li>
        <li><strong>Speed:</strong> No network latency, works offline</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> No servers to compromise, no data to sell</li>
        <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No accounts, no authentication, zero friction</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>The tradeoff:</strong> No cross-device sync. But for researchers who value privacy, this is the right choice.</p>

    <h3>Design System</h3>
</ProjectSection>

<FullWidthImage height="400px" caption="Screenshot showing the visual design system in action" />

<ProjectSection title="Implementation" id="implementation-design" hideTitle={true} group="implementation">
    <p><strong>Colors:</strong> Custom types with user-defined colors. Hierarchy uses grayscale to distinguish depth.</p>
    <p><strong>Typography:</strong> Labels constant size (12px) regardless of zoom. Bold weight for selected node.</p>
    <p><strong>Motion:</strong> Nodes "bloom" outward when appearing (600ms cubic easing). Smooth camera transitions.</p>
    <p><strong>Why organic?</strong> Knowledge graphs should feel like living structures, not rigid diagrams. The physics simulation creates natural spacing—nodes find their own positions through simulated forces.</p>

<ProjectSection title="Reflection" id="reflection">
    <h3>Spatial Interfaces Need Perspective, Not Omniscience</h3>
    <p>My first instinct was to show the entire graph at once. That's overwhelming. <strong>Hero-centric views</strong> solve this: show context from each node's perspective. Maps work because you know where you are. Graphs need the same orientation.</p>

    <h3>Visual Representation Amplifies Thinking</h3>
    <p>Seeing connections makes patterns visible that stay hidden in folders: clusters reveal themes, gaps show unexplored areas, bridges surface insights. The canvas isn't just storage—it's a <strong>thinking tool</strong>.</p>

    <h3>Frictionless Capture is Everything</h3>
    <p>I tested versions with 6, 8, 10 clicks. Every additional step compounds friction. <strong>4 clicks is the maximum</strong> before people abandon the workflow. The right-click save was the make-or-break feature.</p>

    <h3>Users Need Onboarding for Spatial Thinking</h3>
    <p>Spatial organization is powerful but <strong>unfamiliar</strong>. Most people have spent years with folder-based thinking. Next iteration needs guided onboarding showing how to build your first knowledge web.</p>

    <h3>Shipping Teaches What Prototyping Can't</h3>
    <p>Real issues I never saw in Figma: overlapping connections, organizing the 100th dot vs the 10th. <strong>Lesson:</strong> Ship earlier. Real usage reveals real problems that prototypes hide.</p>

    <h3>What Makes a Good Tool for Thought?</h3>
    <p><strong>1. Resist Prescriptiveness:</strong> Don't force structure.</p>
    <p><strong>2. Make Thinking Visible:</strong> Visualization is cognition.</p>
    <p><strong>3. Reduce Friction to Zero:</strong> Input must be frictionless.</p>
    <p><strong>4. Respect Privacy:</strong> Local-first is about trust.</p>
    <p><strong>5. Ship and Learn:</strong> Real usage teaches what assumptions were wrong.</p>
